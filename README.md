# Can pollution link to Central Nervous System diseases?

Neurodegeneration is a process of loss of structure or function of neurons such as the death of neurons. Many neurodegenerative diseases occur as a result of this process. The central nervous system (CNS) controls most functions of the body and the mind. CNS is affected by the neurodegeneration process and causes many disorders and diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and stroke.

Particulate matter or in short term PM are microscopic particulate of solid or liquid matter suspended in the air. Its source can be natural or caused by humans. They have an impact on the climate and precipitation which adversely affect human health. PM 2.5 refers to the size of the particulates with 2.5 micrometers or less. Recently, discoveries have found a link between pollution and CNS disease.

Our team aims to investigate this link by considering the pollution data and CNS disease based on the Italian province available from www.istat.it/it/ambiente-ed-energia?dati' database.

The final results that are obtained by the data analysis is shown by this Dashboard. The dashboard has three main sections, the story mode, which shows insights about the distribution of CNS diseases and pollution in Italy, the visualization section, in which the user is freely allowed to explore the data, and the statistics mode in which relevant statistics are shown about the data, such as correlation between CNS and pollution, and regression results.

The final results not confirm the link between CNS and pollution over the Italian territory, this couold be either due to the effective lack of a link, or to the lack of data to investigate it. 

Feel free to click around the map and to look with your eyes the most polluted cities in Italy, and the one which suffers more of CNS diseases, and the relation between the two.
